<p> This photo was also from our album. My mother Julieta De jesus holding my second sister who's barely a 2 month old on our backyard.
My mother was only 3rd year highschool when she stopped and went here in Cavite to find a better fortune, to find a job because life is very hard at that moment.
Then she met my dad and they fell inlove and settle in Imus. She is very hardworking and a very good mother. She raised the four of us all on her own.
She became a barbeque vendor, labandera at taga-plantsa and also a maid just to sustain our everyday needs and school fees.
She is also a barangay tanod here in Bayan luma VI for 13 years and still counting. </p>
