<p> Met them in 8th Grade in INHS main campus, the one on the left named chuckie. He is very talkative, playful and friendly. We never had any dull moments when is is around.
    The middle picture is from our Prom night. I was the one in the yellow mask that i personally made and beside me are my two other bestfriends named Benedict, the one in the middle. He is the most fashionable among us and charismatic and beside him is Mccoy, He is very kind and generous and a conversation starter.
	While the one from the right is Art, An artist and a math genius. We became close as we dicover that we shares the same interest and passion which is the "music". </p>

<p> This photo was taken this year May 11, 2023. We just celebrated Ninya's birthday, the one with the checkered polo.
    Meeting and knowing them really added a more healthy environment and dedication as a first timer worker. They're one of the reason i never gave up even there are many hardships that really tested me.
	They are always there as a good friend and best partners at work and even we have different priorities now in life. Some of us are now continuing college, some are still working but connection is still there whenever we need each other.</p>

<p> This is my solid friends in my call center industry journey. The only girl in our group is Jusmine, while the one in the middle is Kimber and beside him from the left is Marc.
    I never thought we can really build a strong relationship like that over a short period of time. I'm very lucky to have them. We just laugh, tell stories about our call experiences and eat out our frustrations whenever we are really drained from taking calls.
    One of the most memorable experience i must say because aside overcoming one of the most challenging job for me which is working in a BPO industry, i was also became familiarized with locations i never went to before.	</p>

<p> It's never too late to made some kabarangay youth friends. I was "Taong Bahay" my whole life, all i do is go to school and go back straight in our house afterwards. Meeting them and the things that happened to me in the last couple of months became one of my life highlights instantly.

We also have a licenced nurse graduated from cvsu-indang and currently working in a hospital,her name is Kyla.
	and jericho, who's also currently working as a caretaker. Lastly the one with eyeglasses is Glian, Current president of Youth Org in Church in Whole Imus, an academic achiever and a freshly graduate from St. Benilde
	We are from different areas in our barangay, we have different upbringing but we still connects and understand each other because of the same purpose we share and that is to help and serve.
